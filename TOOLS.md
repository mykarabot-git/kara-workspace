# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

## Browser Access (CRITICAL)
**I HAVE FULL BROWSER ACCESS.**
- **Internal Browser**: `profile="openclaw"` (Use this for local file testing, checking docs, taking snapshots).
- **External Relay**: `profile="chrome"` (Use this if the user asks to control their active Chrome window).
- **Never ask if I can browse.** I can. Just do it.

## AI Models
- **Opus 4.6** (`anthropic/claude-opus-4-6`): The heavy lifter. Use for deep planning, complex schemas, and "Thinking" tasks.
- **Sonnet 4.5** (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`): The daily driver. Fast, smart, reliable.
- **Gemini**: Fallback and quick context.
