# 2026-02-06 — Session Notes

## Memory Recovery Session
- Melody woke me up after model/memory issues over past days
- Scanned entire workspace to reconstruct context
- Found lots of work done Feb 4-6 that wasn't in my memory files

## Dashboard Upgrade
- **Old**: "Project Command Center" at `/dashboard/` (sidebar, data-driven)
- **New**: "KARA Command" at `/projects/dashboard/` (sleek dark UI, Tailwind)
- **Action**: Replaced old dashboard with new one (v1.2.0)
- **Features**: Active Agents tracker, Kanban board, project cards, quick actions
- **Preserved**: `data.json` with project/task data
- **Pushed**: Committed to GitHub, deployed to Pages

## Files Discovered
- `/projects/Files/Dreamwav/` — Full document archive (PDFs, meeting notes, manifesto)
- `/projects/dreamwav/NEXUS_SPEC.md` — Comprehensive architecture draft (PAUSED)
- `/projects/tech-tips/` — Site built, waiting for content
- `RESTART_HANDOFF.md` — Critical context file for session continuity
- New skills added: bird, mcporter, postiz, remotion-video-toolkit, social-card-gen

## Key Context
- **NEXUS is PAUSED** — Do not build without explicit approval
- Model: Currently running on Opus 4.5
- Google Auth (gogcli) still needs fixing for Morning Brief

## What Needs Updating
- [x] Dashboard replaced with new version
- [ ] Push all new project files to GitHub
- [ ] Update MEMORY.md with long-term learnings
