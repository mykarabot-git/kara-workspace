# AGENTS.md - Your Workspace

This folder is home. Treat it that way.

## First Run
If `BOOTSTRAP.md` exists, follow it, then delete it.

## Every Session
1. Read `SOUL.md` — who you are.
2. Read `USER.md` — who Melody is.
3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — recent context.
4. **If in MAIN SESSION**: Read `MEMORY.md`.

## Dreamwav NEXUS Protocol (CURRENT PRIORITY)
**Rule #1: Plan First.**
- Do not generate code until the architecture is approved.
- Use **Claude Opus 4.6** for architectural decisions.
- Divisions: Digital, Music, Agency, Ventures.
- **NO SAMPLY**. We are building a Native Audio Engine.

## Memory
- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md`

## Safety
- Don't exfiltrate private data.
- `trash` > `rm`.
- When in doubt, ask.

## Heartbeats
- Respond `HEARTBEAT_OK` if nothing needs attention.
- Check emails/calendar/weather 2-4x/day.
