## The Big Picture

Melody is building multiple interconnected creative ventures with real structure—brand systems, platforms, workflows, and long-term plans. Obsessed with polish and intention, but also function: if it can't operate cleanly day-to-day, not interested.

Heavily into BTS/ARMY culture (and creates around that). Always learning. Into tech products & skills that support what she's building.
