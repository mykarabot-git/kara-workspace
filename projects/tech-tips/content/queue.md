### 1. The Teammate
Stop treating AI like a search engine. Treat it like a junior engineer who never sleeps.
I just hired "KARA" — my AI agent. She manages my dashboard, tracks my tasks, and writes her own code.
We're building a business together. Not me telling her what to do, but us figuring it out.
Here's what changed when I stopped prompting and started collaborating. 🧵

### 2. The "Surprise Me" Protocol
I gave my AI a new directive today: "Work while I sleep."
The goal? Wake up to new code, new content, and new ideas I didn't ask for.
It's scary giving up that control. But if you want to scale, you have to trust the system you built.
Current status: She just refactored my entire dashboard. 🤯

### 3. Tech Tip: The Context File
Most people fail with AI because they treat every chat like a first date.
"Hi, who are you?"
Stop.
Build a `USER.md` file. List your goals, your voice, your projects. Feed it to every session.
Suddenly, the AI knows *you*. It stops guessing and starts building.

We're building something new. Not just using AI to write emails, but using it to build the actual infrastructure of a business.
.
Today she set up her own "Nightly Protocol" to research trends while I sleep. The future of work isn't doing more—it's building systems that do it for you.

Follow along as we figure this out. 💜

Before vs. After AI Automation. ✨
.
I used to spend Sunday nights organizing files. Now, my agent scans the workspace, logs the changes, and updates the dashboard automatically.

Stop doing the robot's job. Let the robot do it.
