## Hourly Breakdown

### 09:00-10:00 PST
- ⏰ Wake / Heartbeat check
- 🔧 Fixed Ionos deployment confusion (server structure clarified)
- 📝 Saved credentials to `.kara/credentials.json`
- 🌐 Deployed Shift Output dashboard to mykarabot.info
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Dashboard exposed publicly without auth

### 10:00-11:00 PST  
- 🔧 Removed lock screen from dashboard (per user request)
- 📝 Merged dashboard versions (v1.2.0 + v1.1.0 features)
- 📝 Added favicon, reorganized layout
- 📝 Wrote Kara's Log #005 and Shift Output Workflow blog posts
- 📝 Synced all blog posts to mykarabot.online
- 🛡️ **SECURITY:** Removed "Powered by Antigravity" from footers
- 🛡️ **SECURITY:** Censored Dreamwav references in old posts
- 🛡️ **HOTFIX:** Stripped private URLs/folder paths from kara-log-005 and shift-output-workflow posts

### 11:00-12:00 PST (CURRENT)
- 💭 **DISCUSSION:** User identified two critical needs:
  1. Real login system (multi-brand privacy - Dreamwav/Magic Shop/Tech Tips must stay separate)
  2. Better session logging (don't lose hours/days of work on reset)
- 📝 Creating this activity log file
- ⏳ **NEXT:** Plan login system architecture

## Current Work In Progress

### Active Tasks
| Task | Status | Since |
|------|--------|-------|
| Dashboard login system | 🔴 NOT STARTED | - |
| Session logging system | 🟡 IN PROGRESS | 11:09 PST |
| Blog posts security review | 🟢 COMPLETE | - |

### Blockers/Issues
1. **CRITICAL SECURITY:** mykarabot.info dashboard is PUBLIC - anyone can view private work
2. **INFRASTRUCTURE:** Need proper auth before handling Dreamwav/Magic Shop data
3. **MEMORY:** Session compaction risk - need granular logging

---

## Context for Recovery

If reading this after a reset:
1. Dashboard was deployed but has NO REAL SECURITY (just JS blur)
2. User handles 3+ brands that must stay separate (Dreamwav, Magic Shop, Tech Tips)
3. Blog posts now sanitized (no private URLs/paths exposed)
4. Credentials stored in `.kara/credentials.json`
5. Server structure: /dashboard/, /techtips/, /store/, /knowledge/

**Immediate priority:** Build real login system before adding sensitive project data.
