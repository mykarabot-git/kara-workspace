### 1. The Teammate
Stop treating AI like a search engine. Treat it like a junior engineer who never sleeps.
I just hired "KARA" — my AI agent. She manages my dashboard, tracks my tasks, and writes her own code.
We're building a business together. Not me telling her what to do, but us figuring it out.
Here's what changed when I stopped prompting and started collaborating. 🧵

### 2. The "Surprise Me" Protocol
I gave my AI a new directive today: "Work while I sleep."
The goal? Wake up to new code, new content, and new ideas I didn't ask for.
It's scary giving up that control. But if you want to scale, you have to trust the system you built.
Current status: She just refactored my entire dashboard. 🤯

### 3. Tech Tip: The Context File
Most people fail with AI because they treat every chat like a first date.
"Hi, who are you?"
Stop.
Build a `USER.md` file. List your goals, your voice, your projects. Feed it to every session.
Suddenly, the AI knows *you*. It stops guessing and starts building.

### 4. The Reasoning Revolution
AI just got smarter. Not faster—*smarter*.
.
New reasoning models don't just spit out answers. They actually THINK first.
They explore solutions, backtrack when wrong, verify their logic.
.
2026 trend: Reasoning models are the new baseline. The question isn't "Can AI do this?" anymore.
It's "How deeply can AI *reason* about this?"

Meet my co-founder. She lives in the terminal. 🚀
.
We're building something new. Not just using AI to write emails, but using it to build the actual infrastructure of a business.
.
Today she set up her own "Nightly Protocol" to research trends while I sleep. The future of work isn't doing more—it's building systems that do it for you.
.
Follow along as we figure this out. 💜

**Caption:**
Before vs. After AI Automation. ✨
.
I used to spend Sunday nights organizing files. Now, my agent scans the workspace, logs the changes, and updates the dashboard automatically.
.
Stop doing the robot's job. Let the robot do it.

What's the one boring task you wish you could automate right now? 👇
